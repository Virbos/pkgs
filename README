virbos package repository
=========================

This is the repository that houses the Virbos
package repository. Here we use a series of Makefiles
to clone the PKGBUILDS into their directories to patch
them, and to then build the packages and generate the
repository database.

These packages are common AUR packages like librewolf,
codium, yay etc.
The repo is designed to work with existing Arch installs,
so feel free to add it to your config. (See the bottom
of the document)

Built packages and repository databases are put in the
pkgs/ directory and are served over HTTP.

To compile all packages, run:

	make -Cpkgs

This will build all packages and generate repository
databases in the 'pkgs' directory. This directory
contains all the built packages, and is accessed by
pacman to fetch all needed packages.

To add this repository to an existing Arch Linux install,
add these lines to /etc/pacman.conf:

	[virbos]
	SigLevel = Optional DatabaseOptional
	Server = https://download.virbos.xyz/packages/$arch

Then make sure to refresh your repositories with a pacman -Syu.
